<h1>About Delayify</h1>
Delayify is a simple script that puts control of your website loading back into your hands. Delayify delays third party advertisements and scripts until the page has fully loading. Many times advertising and third party scripts take up the majority of the size of your page. No longer is this a problem. Delayify makes it so that your content loads first, and advertising follows.

Our studies have shown that delayify does generally not have a negative impact on revenue due to much higher user retention, faster page loading, and lower bounce rate.

<h2>Using Delayify</h2>
* Wrap all desired scripts to be delayed inside of a textarea like so: &lt;textarea class="delayify" style="display:none;"&gt; ...  &lt;/textarea&gt;
* Includee the delayify.min.js script on your page.
